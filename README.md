# Hi, I’m Pushpit Saluja 👋

I’m a computer science student focused on **cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, and machine learning systems** — with a strong interest in how real-world production systems are designed, operated, and evolved over time.

I care less about memorising tools and more about **understanding systems deeply**.

---

## 🧠 What I focus on

- **Cloud & Infrastructure**
  - AWS fundamentals, load balancing, networking, storage
  - Infrastructure design trade-offs: performance, availability, cost
  - Exploring cloud-native and container-based architectures

- **DevOps Foundations**
  - Linux internals and system behavior
  - Docker and containerisation workflows
  - Automation, observability, and production thinking

- **Machine Learning Systems**
  - ML beyond notebooks: pipelines, deployment, scalability
  - Understanding how ML models behave in real systems
  - Interest in MLOps and ML-infra patterns

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies I work with

- **Languages:** Python, Bash  
- **Platforms:** AWS, Linux  
- **Containers:** Docker  
- **Databases:** SQL, NoSQL fundamentals  
- **Other:** Git, networking basics, system design concepts  

*(I prefer depth over tool-count inflation.)*

## ✍️ Writing & Knowledge Sharing

I write long-form technical articles where I break down complex concepts like:

- Cloud load balancing (ALB vs NLB)
- SSL/TLS termination models
- Databases, storage, and networking fundamentals
- Security and system design trade-offs
- AI & ML systems from a systems perspective

My writing focuses on **mental models, first principles, and real-world constraints** — not copy-paste tutorials.

## 🌍 Open Source & Community

- Contributor to **MediaWiki**
- Member of **WikiClub Tech UU**
- Use open source as a learning ground for:
  - reading real production code
  - understanding review culture
  - seeing how large systems evolve safely
